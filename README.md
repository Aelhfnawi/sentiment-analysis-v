Sentiment Analysis Project
This project analyzes text data (e.g., social media posts, reviews) to classify sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, multiple Machine Learning models, and a Deep Learning model for comparison.

Features
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values

Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization

TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction

Models Implemented:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Deep Learning (Keras Sequential Model)

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion matrix visualization


Results
The notebook compares different models and highlights the best-performing approach based on evaluation metrics.

Future Improvements
Incorporating pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT)

Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy

Deploying the model as an API or web app
